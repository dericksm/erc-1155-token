# ERC1155 Deployed with Moralis Framework 🐱‍🏍

This is a very, very ugly code with the purpose to test the Moralis Framework. 🤢

Basically, we have a ERC1155 contract that is deployed with two base images, which are hosted by a Moralis Server. 
With the usage of Moralis API we can search the data from this given contract and mint or transfer the tokens.  


It was deployed on Rinkeby Network, and you can check the contract with the address 0x35C0215949819cC192941A762B68887DbB01c99d on OpenSea.
